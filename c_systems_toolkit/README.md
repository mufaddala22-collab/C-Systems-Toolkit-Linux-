# C Systems Toolkit (Linux)

A modular C-based systems programming project designed to strengthen low-level programming fundamentals used in embedded, system, and performance-critical software.

---

## Features
- Pointer-based array manipulation and in-place algorithms
- Structure-based data modeling using pointers
- Persistent file logging with error handling
- Hardware-style register simulation using bitwise operations
- Dynamic memory management using malloc/free
- Execution-time benchmarking and performance analysis
- Menu-driven interface for modular execution
- Automated build using Makefile

## Modules Overview

### 1. Array & Pointer Operations
- Pointer arithmetic
- In-place reversal
- Min/Max computation
- O(1) space complexity

### 2. Structure-Based Data Handling
- Real-world data modeling using structs
- Pointer-based access
- Stack vs heap concepts

### 3. File I/O & Logging System
- Timestamped logging
- Append-mode file handling
- Robust error handling

### 4. Bitwise Operations & Register Simulation
- Bit masking (set, clear, toggle, read)
- Binary representation
- Embedded-style register control

### 5. Memory Management
- Dynamic allocation using malloc
- Safe deallocation using free
- Avoidance of memory leaks

### 6. Performance & Timing Analysis
- Index vs pointer-based traversal
- Execution time measurement
- Impact of compiler optimizations
